## Voice of Customer Research

Key pain points identified from Reddit and forum research:

> "I feel like it wasn't enough. A lot of pain and regret that I didn't 'enjoy it enough'..."

> "I don't even feel like I know my husband anymore. Our whole life has revolved around the kids."

> "Kids give you purpose... a much greater purpose than your own existence."
