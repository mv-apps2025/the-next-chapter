## The Struggle: Does This Sound Familiar?

**(A series of text blocks, each with a subtle, elegant icon representing the feeling)**

**"It's just so quiet. I have so much empty space, not only in my home but in my heart. I'm just lost right now..."**

The silence is deafening. The home you built, once buzzing with life, now echoes with emptiness. Every clean room is a reminder of who is missing. You feel a profound sense of loss, a grief that feels too big, too private to share.

**"I feel like it wasn’t enough. A lot of pain and regret that I didn’t ‘enjoy it enough’..."**

Your mind replays the years. Did you cherish it enough? Were you too stressed, too busy building a life that you forgot to live it? The regret is a heavy blanket, suffocating the joy of the memories you do have.

**"I don’t even feel like I know my husband anymore. Our whole life has revolved around the kids. Now what will we talk about?"**

You look at your partner, and a stranger looks back. The shared purpose that held you together for decades is gone. The conversations feel stilted, the connection strained. You're living in the same house, but you've never felt more alone.

**"Kids give you purpose... a much greater purpose than your own existence. What’s going to fill that time?"**

Your identity was 'Mom' or 'Dad' for so long, you've forgotten who you are without them. The days stretch before you, a vast, empty expanse. You feel a terrifying loss of purpose, a crisis of meaning. You're asking, "Who am I now?"
